- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Splide slider library

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I haven't used figure and figcaption elements much outside of tutorials, but the skills grid elements of this site seemed like a good use case to put into action...

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
